Prepare Postgres

    Run Postgres and load data as shown in the videos We'll use the green taxi trips from September 2019:

    wget https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/green/green_tripdata_2019-09.csv.gz

    You will also need the dataset with zones:

    wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/misc/taxi+_zone_lookup.csv

    Download this data and put it into Postgres (with jupyter notebooks or with a pipeline)
