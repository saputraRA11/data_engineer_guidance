must be done (testing join):
DELETE FROM yellow_taxi_data WHERE yellow_taxi_data."PULocationID" = 68
DELETE FROM zones WHERE zones."LocationID" = 142

Count all record: 

SELECT COUNT(1) FROM zones;

implicit join to see how much price of trip:

SELECT 
	tpep_pickup_datetime,
	tpep_dropoff_datetime,
	total_amount,
	CONCAT(zpu."Borough",' / ', zpu."Zone", ' id: ',zpu."LocationID")  AS "pickup_loc",
	CONCAT(zdo."Borough",' / ', zdo."Zone",' id: ',zdo."LocationID") AS "dropoff_loc"
FROM 
yellow_taxi_data t,
zones zpu,
zones zdo
WHERE
 t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID" AND
 t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID" 
LIMIT 100;

explicit join to see how much price of trip:

Check Dropoff or Pickup location id not in zones

SELECT

FROM

LIMIT 100;

OUTER JOIN dont include inner join

SELECT

ORDER BY total_amount DESC
LIMIT 10000;


RIGHT OR LEFT JOIN by default include inner join

SELECT

RIGHT JOIN zones zpu on t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
WHERE t."PULocationID" IS NULL
ORDER BY total_amount DESC
LIMIT 10000;

RIGHT JOIN just SELECT RIGHT use this:

SELECT 
	tpep_pickup_datetime,
	tpep_dropoff_datetime,
	total_amount,
	CONCAT(zpu."Borough",' / ', zpu."Zone", ' id: ',zpu."LocationID")  AS "pickup_loc",

RIGHT JOIN zones zpu on t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"

ORDER BY total_amount DESC
LIMIT 10000;

LEFT JOIN just select LEFT use this:

SELECT

LEFT JOIN zones zpu on t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"

ORDER BY total_amount DESC
LIMIT 10000;

FULL OUTER JOIN default include inner join, select all data

SELECT 
	tpep_pickup_datetime,

	total_amount,
	CONCAT(zpu."Borough",' / ', zpu."Zone")  AS "pickup_loc",

yellow_taxi_data t 
FULL OUTER JOIN zones zpu on t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
ORDER BY pickup_loc DESC,total_amount DESC
LIMIT 10000;

GROUP BY for aggregations

see total order by day ascending

SELECT 
	CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE) as "day",
	COUNT(1)
FROM
 yellow_taxi_data t
GROUP BY
 CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE)
ORDER BY "day" ASC
LIMIT 100;

see total order by total descending

SELECT 
	CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE) as "day",
	COUNT(1) as "count"
FROM
 yellow_taxi_data t
GROUP BY
 CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE)
ORDER BY "count" desc
LIMIT 100;

see total,top of total amount, top of total passenger order by total descending

SELECT 
	CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE) as "day",
	COUNT(1) as "count",
	MAX(total_amount) as "max_total",
	MAX(passenger_count) as "max_passenger"
FROM
 yellow_taxi_data t
GROUP BY
 CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE)
ORDER BY "count" desc
LIMIT 100;

group by day and dropoff id

SELECT 
	CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE) as "day",
	"DOLocationID",
	COUNT(1) as "count",
	MAX(total_amount) as "max_total",
	MAX(passenger_count) as "max_passenger"
FROM
 yellow_taxi_data t
GROUP BY
1,2
ORDER BY "count" desc
LIMIT 100;
