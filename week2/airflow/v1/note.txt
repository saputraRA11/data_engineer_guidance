what is data pipeline? 

    * a bunch of paremter script in a job that takes one or more data sources.
    * doing something with input of data sources.
    * producing one or more new dataset as well.
    * data workflow = data pipeline

DAG 

    * DAG = directed acyclic graph

    * graph is job of workflow

    * edges of graph is output of some product from job.

    * directed means job depends on which one.

    * acyclic means workflow has loop in job but this for some error in workflow (we can call this as rollback job)

    * active workflow doesn't have loop and active workflow is cyclic for lifecycle (directed cyclic graph)

    * DAG good for retrying workflow if there are some case to be retried.
