Best practices query

Cost reduction

    * Avoid select with *
    * price our queries before running them
    * Use clustered or partitioned tables
    * use streaming inserts with caution (streaming can increase cost drastically)
    * materialize query result in stages (check query like a cte every location environments)

Query performance

    * filter on partitioned columns
    * Denormalizing data
    * use nested or repeated columns
    * use external data sources appropriately
    * reduce data before using a join 
    * do not treat WITH clauses as prepared statements
    * Avoid oversharding tables

    * Avoid javascript user-defined functions
    * Use approximate aggregate function (HyperLogLog++)
    * Order Last,for query operations to maximizes performance
    * Optimize your join patterns
    * As a best practices,
    place the table with largest number of rows first,followed by table with 
    the fewest rows, and then place the remaining tables by decreasing size.
