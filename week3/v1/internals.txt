biguery internal seperate in:
    borg (server) inside of this:
        1) cli
        2) dremel (query execution/compute query)
            query divide in tree structures.
        3) jupyter (communicate between dremel and colussus)
            network has speed 1 TB/seconds.
        4) colossus (storage of biguery) 
            storage is very cheap and columnar format

record/row-oriented vs column-oriented

    row-oriented:
        * this example is csv
        * easy to process and understand data
    
    column-oriented:
        * this example is bigquery
        * easy to aggregating data
        * avoid query all column in one time

how dremel actualy work:
    *) dremel is query processing in bigquery
    *) data processing in tree structures for divide query into smaller chunks to colossus.
    *) aggregating is fast because query divide into smaller chunks.
